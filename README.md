# CollatzProblem
Simple console program I created for the Collatz problem

[How the programm works]
You type in any positive number, if the number is even you divide it by 2, if the number is odd you multiply by 3 and add 1
You repeat this until you end up with 1, just 1 nothing more nothing less

Pretty cool lol
